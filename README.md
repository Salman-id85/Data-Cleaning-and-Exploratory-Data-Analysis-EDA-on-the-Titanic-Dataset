# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset
Project Overview
This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal is to prepare the dataset for modeling and gain insights into the factors influencing passenger survival.

# Features
Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the Titanic dataset to handle missing values, incorrect data types, and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to understand the relationships between features and their impact on passenger survival.
Visualization: Creating visualizations to effectively communicate findings and patterns.
Workflow
# Data Collection

Dataset: Load the Titanic dataset, which includes features such as passenger demographics, ticket details, and survival status.
Data Cleaning

Handling Missing Values: Identify and address missing values in columns such as Age, Cabin, and Embarked.
Data Type Conversion: Ensure all columns have the correct data types (e.g., convert categorical variables to numeric codes).
Outlier Detection: Detect and handle any outliers that may affect the analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Descriptive Statistics: Compute basic statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation for numerical features.
Categorical Analysis: Analyze the distribution of categorical variables such as Sex, Pclass, and Embarked.
Survival Analysis: Investigate survival rates across different features such as age groups, gender, and passenger class.
# Visualization

Univariate Analysis: Create histograms, bar charts, and pie charts to visualize distributions of individual features.
Bivariate Analysis: Use scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps to explore relationships between features and survival rates.
Correlation Analysis: Examine correlations between numerical features and survival outcomes.
Insights and Findings

Key Patterns: Summarize key patterns and relationships discovered during EDA.
Impact on Survival: Highlight features that significantly impact survival rates, such as age, gender, and passenger class.
# Recommendations

Further Analysis: Suggest areas for further analysis or feature engineering based on the EDA results.
Model Preparation: Provide insights that can inform the development of predictive models for passenger survival.
# Setup and Usage
Installation: Clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip or conda.
Data Preparation: Follow the provided instructions to load and clean the Titanic dataset.
Analysis: Run the EDA scripts to generate descriptive statistics and visualizations.
Interpretation: Review the visualizations and insights to understand the dataset better.
