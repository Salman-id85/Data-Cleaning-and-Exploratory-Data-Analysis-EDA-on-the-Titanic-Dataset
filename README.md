# Load the Data:
Start by importing the Titanic dataset into your analysis environment. The dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle.

# Data Cleaning:

Inspect the Data: Review the first few rows to understand the dataset's structure and identify any immediate issues.

Check for Missing Values: Identify columns with missing data and determine how to address them. Common strategies include imputing missing values with the median for numerical columns or with the mode for categorical columns.

Handle Missing Values: For missing ages, consider using the median age. For missing embarkation points, use the most frequent value. Ensure all categorical variables are correctly encoded and handle any duplicate entries.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Descriptive Statistics: Generate summary statistics for numerical features to understand the data's central tendency and spread.

Distribution of Variables: Examine the distribution of key variables like age and fare to understand their spread and any potential skewness.

Survival Rate Analysis: Analyze survival rates based on different categories such as passenger class, gender, and embarkation point. This can reveal patterns and trends, such as which groups had higher survival rates.

Through these steps, you will clean the data and uncover insights that help understand the underlying patterns and trends in the Titanic dataset.
